# IoT Event Ingestion Service

Welcome to the **IoT Event Ingestion Service**! This project is designed to manage IoT devices and their events efficiently. The service enables device registration, event logging, and querying with a robust backend architecture.

## Overview
This repository is organized into multiple folders, each dedicated to a specific component of the IoT backend system. Each folder contains its own `README.md` file with detailed instructions on how to set up, run, and test that specific component. **It is crucial to go through each README file in order to fully understand and use the project.**

## Project Highlights üöÄ
- **Device Management**: Easily register and manage IoT devices.
- **Event Processing**: Log and query events generated by devices.
- **Scalable Design**: Built with FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and modern Python frameworks.
- **Test Coverage**: Fully tested components with `pytest`.
